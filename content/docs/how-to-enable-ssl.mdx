There are three options on how to configure SSL/TLS on your Fider instance.

### 1. Automatic HTTPS with Let's Encrypt

This is the easiest of all options because Fider integrates with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) natively. There is no need to install anything else or buy your own certificate.

To enable it, add the following to your docker-compose.yml and restart your application.

```
version: '2'
services:
  db:
    ...
  app:
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:3000"
    environment:
      ...
      HOST_DOMAIN: feedback.yoursite.com
      SSL_AUTO: "true"
```

It can take a few seconds on the initial request to generate a certificate, but after visiting `https://feedback.yoursite.com` you'll should see the green lock and the certificate generated for you.

**NOTE**: You must enable firewall access on port 80 and 443. Fider will redirect all traffic from HTTP to HTTPS.

### 2. HTTPS with your own certificate

You can also buy (or generate) a certificate and use it on Fider. Copy your `.crt` and `.key` files into `/var/fider/etc/`, add the following to your docker-compose.yml and restart your application.

```
version: '2'
services:
  db:
    ...
  app:
    ports:
      - "443:3000"
    environment:
      ...
      HOST_DOMAIN: feedback.yoursite.com
      SSL_CERT: filename.crt
      SSL_CERT_KEY: filename.key
    volumes:
      - /var/fider/etc:/app/etc
```

### 3. HTTPS with a Reverse Proxy

It's also possible to host Fider behind a reverse proxy which acts as a TLS termination proxy, giving you extra flexibility, but with an added cost of managing another service. It's beyond the scope of this page to explain how to set it up, but these are the most popular options:
